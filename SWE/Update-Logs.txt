December 19th, 2022: I reviewed the script one last time and found some code that could
			result in a bug or skip a blocking function for messages. I had
			over looked the findstr function needed in case a blocked user
			sends a file a profile/user that has them blocked. All blocked
			messages are sent to a designated folder for records to report
			any harassment within the server/shared network.
